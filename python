""" You are tasked with developing a program that calculates the nth term of a geometric series. Given the first term (a), the common ratio (r), and the term number (n), the program computes the nth term of the series using a recursive algorithm.



The nth term of a geometric series (Tn) can be calculated using the formula: Tn=a×r(n−1)



Example:

Input: a = 2 r = 2, N = 4

Output: 16

Explanation:

a=2 represents the first term of the geometric series.

r=2 is the common ratio.

n=4 denotes the term number.

According to the formula Tn =a×r(n−1):

T4 =2×2 (4−1) =2×23=2×8=16

So, the 4th term of the geometric series with a=2 and r=2 is 16.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer representing the first term (a) of the geometric series.

The second line of input consists of an integer representing the common ratio (r) of the geometric series.

The third line of input consists of an integer representing the term number (n) to calculate.

Output format :
The output consists of a single integer containing the nth term of the geometric series.
